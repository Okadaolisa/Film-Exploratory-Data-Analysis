# Project Title: **Film Exploratory Data Analysis**

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of films. The analysis focuses on uncovering insights related to film metadata, such as ratings, genres, and performance metrics. Visualization and statistical tools are employed to derive meaningful patterns and relationships within the dataset.

---

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Seamlessly loads film metadata from a CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, outliers, and standardizes data formats.
- **Visualization**: Leverages `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for advanced plotting and visual analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performs hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and descriptive statistics.

---

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.12 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (listed below):
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
  ```

---

## Key Libraries Used
```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import re
import scipy.stats as stats
import math
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
import pandas as pd
pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format
```

---

## Dataset
The notebook works with the following dataset:
- **File Name**: `movie_metadata.csv`
- **Contents**: Metadata about films, including ratings, genres, revenue, and more.

Place the dataset file in the same directory as the notebook for smooth execution.

---

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/film-eda.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd film-eda
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Film Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb"
   ```
4. Execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

---

## Example Workflow
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load the dataset using:
   ```python
   myfile = 'movie_metadata.csv'
   df = pd.read_csv(myfile)
   ```
3. Perform EDA:
   - Summary statistics
   - Visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, scatter plots)
   - Hypothesis testing
4. Derive actionable insights.

---

## Outputs
- **Visualizations**: Heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots.
- **Insights**: Correlation coefficients, descriptive statistics, and distribution patterns.
- **Cleaned Data**: A processed dataset ready for advanced modeling.
